#### Future Additions

A feature to be implemented in the future is a map with the location of the school at the bottom of the home page.

### Surface

The surface design of the website is aimed to convey an artistic flair, while remaining uncluttered, and maintaining easy of readability. The color schemes and font were chosen accordingly.

#### Color Scheme

The color scheme is a balance of vibrant colors that draw attention and convey artistic energy. A vibrant purple color was chosen in conjunction with the hero image and a desire for them to blend together. It was used to frame all important information on the site and all clickable buttons are styled with this color. The remaining features on the site and font are a balance of a dark grey or black, as well as white or off white in order to maintain contrast and readability.

#### Font

Kalam is the font used for high level heading such as the business name, text in the main body of the site and lowerlevel headings use Shantell Sans font. These fonts were chosen for the artistic character and to convey the fluency and flexibility of artistic experimentation.

### Accessibility & Performance

The Lighthouse feature on Google Devtools was used to assess accessibility and performance. All pages score high on accessibility. The gallery page scores lowest on performance due to the large number of images.

</details>

#### Outstanding Issues

During testing using Lighthouse issues related to performance and SEO were flaged, specifically on the Home page and Gallery page. Work to reduce these issues should continue. This will further improve the user experience.

#### Room for improvement on User Stories

While all the minimum criteria for fullfilling the user stories are met, there are several items that could be improved upon:

1. A map could be included at the bottom of the home page to give more explicit directions to the location. This would strengthen user story number 9.

2. A  more explicit section or link could be provided on new services, news, or special events. This would stengthen user story number 7.

3. More information about the fascilities could be included, in the form of text about or images of the building, rooms, art supplies and materials provided at the space. This would strengthen user story number 5. 


## Bugs & Fixes

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Images framed in the philosophy section failed to be responsive at very small screen sizes. | Max-width of image was set to 90% and margins to % values also for more responsiveness |
| Header styling failed on small screen sizes | Font size of logo and menu was decreased and menu floated left to fit header on two lines |
| Spurious tiny underscore lines appeared between the social media links when using 'display: inline' for the CSS styling of the .social-networks class. | Using 'display: flex' eliminated the lines. | 

## Deployment & Development

The website was deployed using GitHub Pages by following these steps:

1. In the GitHub respository navigate to the Settings tab.
2. Select Pages from the menu on the left-hand side of the page.
3. For the source select Branch: 'main' and then select: 'save'.
4. After the webpage refreshes automatically a ribbon at the top will displays the following message: "Your site is live at https://uriem.github.io/art-school/"

The website repository can be forked by the following steps:

1. Go to the GitHub repository.
2. Click on the Fork button in the upper right hand corner.

The repository can be cloned by the following steps:

1. Got to the GitHub repository.
2. Locade the Code button above the list of files and click on it.
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or Github CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard.
